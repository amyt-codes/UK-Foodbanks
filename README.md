# UK-Foodbanks
A project for my own interest using SQL to clean, manipulate and use queries to extract relevant data to create visualisations. I collated data from 2 different sources: a datbase of food banks currently open in the UK from the GiveFood charity, and a database of annual food packages distributed at Trussell Trust food banks.

The 2 original datasets are in the repository as 'foodbanks 13.06.23.csv' with the most up to date version available on GitHub at https://github.com/givefood/data/blob/main/foodbanks.csv, and 'Trussell-Trust-End-of-Year-Statistics-2022-23.csv'.
I cleaned and manipulated this data locally in MySQL, using queries to extract summary data that would be used for data visualisation. I then exported this tables as CSV filed to be used in PowerBI.

In PowerBI I created a dashboard visualising the current composition of foodbanks in the UK by country, a map showing the areas with the highest density of foodbanks and the increasing rate of food bank use in the UK since 2018.
